# Insurance_Prem_Calc_Python
A project I created via request by a friend to retrieve annual earthquake insurance premiums for a list of zip codes via a specific California website (https://calc.earthquakeauthority.com/app/) using the Selenium web driver, followed by placing the retrieved data in a csv file. It also represents my first attempt/exploration at threading and is very slow and resource intensive. I have a lot to learn.
